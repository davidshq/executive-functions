- Should allow users to create custom workflows.
- The workflow should walk one through the process of managing one's projects/life.

### Daily Workflow

- Choose which items to work on today.
- Choose how to work on each item (schedule, do now, delegate).
- Observe what is making / breaking you (e.g. time leeches, time savers).
- Prioritize Tasks - Rate tasks according to Impact (High/Low) and Effort (High/Low).

## Goals

- Should support a method for adding big picture goals that help keep the focus on what is important.

## Dashboard

- Should provide us a high-level overview of what we need to do today, this week, and this month, long-term.

## Review View

## Delegation View

- These individuals should not need to use the system.

## Capture Methods

- One should be able to use any of the cross-platform applications.
