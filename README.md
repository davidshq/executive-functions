# Executive Functions

## Overview

What would a project / life management system look like that provided accommodations for people with various limitations. 

What sort of limitations?

1. Variable Attention Span
2. Inconsistent Energy Levels
3. Chronically Ill
4. Inconsistent / Limited Unallotted Time

## Goals

1. Design a system that can be used to manage projects, tasks, and life.
2. Make the system with a realistic and attainable scope.
3. Make the system cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, Web, paper maybe).
4. Should provide robust, no fuss syncing across systems.
5. Make it open source and free.
6. Implement functionality and systems that accommodate the limitations listed above.
7. Make it as simple and intuitive as possible.
8. Use a simple and open format for data storage.

## Dive Deeper
- [Core Functionality](core-functionality.md) - The most basic functionality the system must support.
- [Desirable Functionality](desirable-functionality.md) - Functionality that would be nice to have, but is not required.
- [No Functionality](no-functionality.md) - Functionality that will not be included in the system.
- [Best of Functionality](best-of-functionality.md) - An evaluation of what existing products and what makes them amazing to discover the best of functionality and consider it for implementation.
- [Non-User Functionality](non-user-functionality.md) - How to integrate people who aren't using the system into the system - e.g., someone who you are holding responsible for completing a task but isn't part of the organization, e.g. could be a designer outside of the organization or an auto mechanic who doesn't use the system.

## Other Systems

In this section you'll find links to analyses of other systems I've found to offer something unique or interesting - or perhaps just because the system is popular and this section would seem incomplete without it.
